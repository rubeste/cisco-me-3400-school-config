# cisco-me-3400-school-config
Just a default config I created for a few switches I gave to FHICT.

## Note
This is just a config file I created. It has nothing to do with any Internal network of FHICT or any other organization.

## Installation
Go to my document or google it. Be gratefull I made this file so you don't have to `no shut` & `port-type nni` on each FA interface.
